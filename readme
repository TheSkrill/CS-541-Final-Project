#Trajectron++ - CS 541 Final Project 

## Weekly Updates

Starting off - April 13th - 4.49PM

April 20th - 9.44PM
* Processed the ETH/UCY datasets into a dictionary.
*Formatted the data to make it compatible to feed it into the Trajectron++ model.
*Initiated the training. Trained for 50 epochs, with a 80-20 split.

April 27th - 11.53PM (Phew.. Just before the deadline)
*Trained the ETH/UCY datasets completely.
*Included all the detailed results obtained after training.
*Modified the report - added diagrams and details of the experiments.

May 4th - 9.37PM 
*Added all the files on the system onto the GitHub repo with final changes
*Updated the project report with Abstract, Introduction, minor details about experiments and conclusion.
*Binged Star Wars after completing this project!!!



## Trajectron++

This project contains the code for Trajectron++ and the instructions to train it on the ETH/UCY data.



### Step 1 : Clone the repo using the following command  

> git clone --recurse-submodules <repository cloning URL>

###Step 2 : Create a conda environment to store all the dependencies

> conda create --name trajectron++ python=3.6 -y
> source activate trajectron++
> pip install -r requirements.txt

###Step 3 : Import and process the data
> cd experiments/pedestrians

###Step 4 : Put the model for training using the following command!
> python train.py --eval_every 10 --vis_every 1 --train_data_dict <dataset>_train.pkl --eval_data_dict <dataset>_val.pkl --offline_scene_graph yes --preprocess_workers 5 --log_dir ../experiments/pedestrians/models --log_tag <desired tag> --train_epochs 100 --augment --conf <desired model configuration>
